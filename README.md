# ML-Practice
Hands on practice to implement ML algorithms on various datasets

This repository is to rewrite the codes that are present in the books I read.

1. Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow
2. Python for Data Analysis
3. Python Machine Learning

All the code is from the following github repositories:
1. https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml
2. https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book
3. https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book/tree/master/code

I am using this for learning/practice puposes to understand along with reading the books.
