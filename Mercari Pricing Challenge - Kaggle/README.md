# Mercari Pricing Challenge - Kaggle
Practicing building prediction models using Kaggle Dataset.

This notebook contains code heavily borrowed from another notebook developed by Randy Lao. (https://github.com/randylaosat/Price-Recommendation-Mercari-Challenge). The goal of this project is to:
1. Finish an end to end project
2. Learn the mechanisms of prediction model building
3. Learn to read/organize code.

I am using this for learning/practice puposes to understand along with reading other content.
